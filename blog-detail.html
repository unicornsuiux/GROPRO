                        A though many geographers are trained in toponymy and cartology, this is not their main
                        preoccupation. Geographers study the space and the temporal database distribution of phenomena,
                        processes, and features as. Well as the interaction of humans and their environment. Because
                        space and place affect a variety of topics,

                        well as the interaction of humans and their environment. Because space and place affect a
                        variety of topics, such as economics, health, climate, plants and animals, geography is highly
                        interdisciplinary. The interdisciplinary nature of the geographical approach depends
                        on an attentiveness to the relationship between physical and human phenomena and its spatial
                        patterns.

                    <p>
                        A discipline can be split broadly into two main subsidiary fields: human geography and physical
                        geography. The former largely focuses on the built environment and how humans create, view,
                        manage, and influence space. The latter examines the natural environment, and how organisms,
                        climate, soil, water, and landforms produce and interact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The difference between these approaches led to a third field, environmental geography,
                        which combines physical and human geography and concerns the interactions between
                        the environment and humans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Greeks, who were the first to explore geography as both art and science, achieved this
                        through Cartography, Philosophy, and Literature, or through Mathematics. There is some debate
                        about who was the first person to assert that the Earth is spherical in shape, with the credit
                        going either to Parmenides or Pythagoras. Anaxagoras was able to demonstrate that the profile of
                        the Earth was circular by explaining eclipses. However, he still believed that the Earth was a
                        flat disk, as did many of his contemporaries.

                                descriptions of five of them have survived. In contrast to the Imago Mundi, an earlier
                                Babylonian world map dating back to the 9th century BC depicted Babylon as being further
                                north from the center of the worl.
